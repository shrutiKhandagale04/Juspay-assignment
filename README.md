# Scratch Clone Project

## Overview

This project is a Scratch clone that replicates some of the core functionalities of the Scratch programming environment. Users can create animations using multiple sprites, implement motion animations, and enjoy dynamic interactions between characters. The project also features the ability to reset the workspace for a fresh start.

## Features

1. **Motion Animations:**
   - Users can drag and drop the following motion commands:
     - Move ____ steps
     - Turn ____ degrees
     - Go to x: ___ y: ____
     - Repeat animations (inside controls)

2. **Multiple Sprites Support:**
   - Create multiple sprites and assign animations to each.
   - All animations from the Motion category are available for each sprite.
   - A play button starts the animations for all sprites simultaneously.

3. **Hero Feature - Collision-Based Animation Swap:**
   - Swaps animations between two sprites when they collide.
   - For example:
     - Character 1: Move 10 steps
     - Character 2: Move -10 steps
     - After collision, their animations swap.

4. **Reset Workspace:**
   - A reset button clears the workspace, allowing users to start over without manual cleanup.
